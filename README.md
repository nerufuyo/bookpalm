### Technical Implementation

#### Translation Files Structure
```
assets/translations/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ en.json          # English (default)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ id.json          # Indonesian
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ de.json          # German
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ja.json          # Japanese
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ zh.json          # Chinese
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ko.json          # Korean
```

#### Translation Keys Organization
```json
{
  "app": {
    "title": "BookPalm",
    "subtitle": "Discover Free Books"
  },
  "navigation": {
    "home": "Home",
    "bookmarks": "Bookmarks",
    "settings": "Settings"
  },
  "actions": {
    "search": "Search",
    "filter": "Filter",
    "bookmark": "Bookmark",
    "share": "Share"
  },
  "messages": {
    "loading": "Loading...",
    "error": "An error occurred",
    "success": "Operation completed successfully",
    "offline": "You're offline. Showing cached content.",
    "connection_restored": "Connection restored. Syncing data..."
  }
}
```

#### LocalizationService Features

The `LocalizationService` provides:

- **Reactive Translation**: Using GetX for instant UI updates
- **Parameter Interpolation**: Support for dynamic content like `"Hello, {name}!"`
- **Fallback Mechanism**: Falls back to English if translation is missing
- **Type Safety**: Compile-time checking of translation keys
- **Performance**: Efficient caching of loaded translations

#### Usage in Code

```dart
// Simple translation
Text(LocalizationService.instance.translate('navigation.home'))

// Translation with parameters
Text(LocalizationService.instance.translate('messages.welcome', {'name': 'John'}))

// Using GetX for reactive updates
Obx(() => Text(LocalizationService.instance.translate('app.title')))
```

### For Developers & Contributors

#### Adding New Languages

1. **Create Translation File**: Add a new JSON file in `assets/translations/` (e.g., `fr.json` for French)
2. **Copy Structure**: Use `en.json` as a template and translate all values
3. **Update LocalizationService**: Add the new language to `supportedLanguages` list
4. **Update Settings**: Add the language option to the settings dropdown
5. **Test**: Verify all UI elements display correctly in the new language

#### Adding New Translation Keys

1. **Add to English**: First add the new key-value pair to `en.json`
2. **Translate**: Add the same key with translated values to all other language files
3. **Use in Code**: Reference the new key in your widgets/controllers
4. **Test**: Verify the translation appears correctly in all supported languages

#### Translation Guidelines

- **Keep Keys Descriptive**: Use hierarchical keys like `settings.language.title`
- **Maintain Consistency**: Use the same key structure across all language files
- **Handle Pluralization**: Use parameters for dynamic content that changes based on count
- **Consider Context**: Some words may have different translations in different contexts
- **Test Thoroughly**: Always test UI layout with longer/shorter translated text

### Localization Assets Setup

Update `pubspec.yaml` to include translation assets:

```yaml
flutter:
  assets:
    - assets/translations/
```

### Dependencies for Localization

```yaml
dependencies:
  get: ^4.6.6                 # State management and reactivity
  shared_preferences: ^2.3.2  # Persistent language storage
```

### Future Localization Enhancements

Planned features for future releases:

- **Right-to-Left (RTL) Support**: For Arabic, Hebrew, and other RTL languages
- **Pluralization Rules**: Advanced plural forms for different languages
- **Date/Number Formatting**: Locale-specific formatting
- **Currency Support**: Multi-currency display for paid content
- **Dynamic Translation Loading**: Download translations on-demand
- **Translation Management**: Admin interface for managing translations

### Troubleshooting Localization

#### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Missing Translations**: If text appears as keys (e.g., "settings.title"), check if the key exists in the current language file
2. **Layout Issues**: Some languages may have longer text - ensure UI components can accommodate varying text lengths
3. **Special Characters**: Ensure proper UTF-8 encoding in JSON files for special characters
4. **Parameter Issues**: When using parameters, ensure the placeholder names match exactly

## üîÑ Offline Mode

BookPalm features comprehensive offline functionality, ensuring users can continue reading and browsing even without an internet connection.

### Key Offline Features

- **üì± Seamless Offline Experience**: Continue using the app when internet is unavailable
- **üíæ Intelligent Caching**: Automatically cache books and search results for offline access
- **üîç Offline Search**: Browse previously cached search results without internet
- **üìö Offline Bookmarks**: Access all bookmarked books regardless of connection status
- **‚ö° Fast Loading**: Cached content loads instantly without network delays
- **üîÑ Auto-Sync**: Automatically sync new data when connection is restored
- **‚öôÔ∏è Cache Management**: Full control over cached data through settings

### How Offline Mode Works

#### When Online:
- App fetches fresh data from Project Gutenberg API
- Successful responses are automatically cached in local SQLite database
- Users can browse, search, and bookmark normally
- Connection status displays "Connected to Internet" in settings

#### When Offline:
- App detects loss of internet connection
- Orange banner appears: "You're offline. Showing cached content."
- App serves previously cached data instead of showing errors
- All core functionality remains available:
  - Browse previously viewed books
  - Access complete bookmark collection
  - View cached search results
  - Read detailed book information
  - Navigate between all cached content

#### When Connection Restored:
- Green notification appears: "Connection restored. Syncing data..."
- App automatically resumes online operation
- New requests fetch fresh data from the internet
- Cache is updated with latest content

### Technical Implementation

#### Database & Caching
```sql
-- Cached individual books
CREATE TABLE cached_books (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  book_data TEXT NOT NULL,
  cached_at INTEGER NOT NULL
);

-- Cached book list responses (search results)
CREATE TABLE cached_book_lists (
  list_key TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  list_data TEXT NOT NULL,
  page INTEGER NOT NULL,
  cached_at INTEGER NOT NULL
);
```

#### Cache Strategy
1. **Network First**: Always attempt to fetch fresh data when online
2. **Cache on Success**: Store all successful API responses locally
3. **Fallback to Cache**: Serve cached data when network is unavailable
4. **Smart Expiration**: Automatically clean up cache entries older than 7 days
5. **Selective Caching**: Cache both individual books and search result lists

#### Architecture Components
- **DatabaseHelper**: SQLite database management for offline storage
- **ConnectionService**: Real-time connectivity monitoring with GetX
- **Enhanced Repository Pattern**: Network-first with intelligent cache fallbacks
- **Offline Indicators**: Visual feedback for connection status

### Settings & Cache Management

Access comprehensive cache management through the Settings tab:

#### Connection Status
- Real-time display of internet connectivity
- Visual indicators for online/offline state
- Connection history and status changes

#### Cache Statistics
- Number of cached books
- Number of cached search lists
- Total cache size information
- Last cache update timestamp

#### Cache Controls
- **Refresh Stats**: Update cache statistics display
- **Clear All Cache**: Remove all cached content (preserves bookmarks)
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Configure cache expiration settings

### Dependencies for Offline Mode
```yaml
dependencies:
  sqflite: ^2.4.1              # Local SQLite database
  path: ^1.9.0                 # Database path utilities
  connectivity_plus: ^6.0.5    # Connection monitoring
  shared_preferences: ^2.3.2   # Persistent bookmark storage
```

### Testing Offline Functionality

1. **Populate Cache**: 
   - Run app with internet connection
   - Browse several books and perform searches
   - Add bookmarks to test offline bookmark access

2. **Test Offline Mode**:
   - Disable internet connection on device
   - Navigate through the app
   - Verify cached content loads properly
   - Check offline indicator appears

3. **Test Connection Restoration**:
   - Re-enable internet connection
   - Verify "Connection restored" notification
   - Confirm fresh data fetching resumes

### Performance Benefits

- **‚ö° Instant Loading**: Cached content loads without network latency
- **üìä Reduced Data Usage**: Fewer API calls for repeated content
- **üîã Battery Efficiency**: Less network activity preserves device battery
- **üåê Poor Connection Handling**: Graceful degradation in low-connectivity areas
